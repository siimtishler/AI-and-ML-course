The provided code sets up the CNN model, compiles it, 
and trains it on a training set of 60,000 images. 
The model is then tested on a separate set of 10,000 images, 
and its predictions are evaluated for accuracy.
The end result accuracy was:

`Correct classes: 8907 of 10000 (accuracy: 0.8907)`

With further testing the end result varied by +-40 correct classes.

If a program were to randomly assign a class (0-9) to each picture in the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the accuracy would be expected to be around 10%. This is because, on average, random guessing would yield the correct class approximately 1 out of 10 times.
So, the accuracy would be 10%, and this serves as a baseline for evaluating the performance of any machine learning model applied to the same classification task.
